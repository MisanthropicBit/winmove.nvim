CONFIGURATION                                          *winmove-configuration*

If you are content with the defaults that are shown below, you don’t need to
call the `configure` function. No default keymaps are set other than those
active during modes.

>lua
    require('winmove').configure({
        highlights = {
            move = "Search", -- Highlight group for move mode
            resize = "Substitute", -- Highlight group for resize mode
        },
        wrap_around = true, -- Wrap around edges when moving windows
        default_resize_count = 3, -- Default amount to resize windows
        keymaps = {
            help = "?", -- Open floating window with help for the current mode
            help_close = "q", -- Close the floating help window
            quit = "q", -- Quit current mode
            toggle_mode = "<tab>", -- Toggle between move and resize modes
            move = {
                left = "h", -- Move window left
                down = "j", -- Move window down
                up = "k", -- Move window up
                right = "l", -- Move window right
                far_left = "H", -- Move window far left and maximize it
                far_down = "J", -- Move window down and maximize it
                far_up = "K", -- Move window up and maximize it
                far_right = "L", -- Move window right and maximize it
                split_left = "sh", -- Create a split with the window on the left
                split_down = "sj", -- Create a split with the window below
                split_up = "sk", -- Create a split with the window above
                split_right = "sl", -- Create a split with the window on the right
            },
            resize = {
                -- When resizing, the anchor is in the top-left corner of the window
                left = "h", -- Resize to the left
                down = "j", -- Resize down
                up = "k", -- Resize up
                right = "l", -- Resize to the right
                left_botright = "<c-h>", -- Resize left with bottom-right anchor
                down_botright = "<c-j>", -- Resize down with bottom-right anchor
                up_botright = "<c-k>", -- Resize up with bottom-right anchor
                right_botright = "<c-l>", -- Resize right with bottom-right anchor
            },
        },
    })

AUTOCOMMANDS                                            *winmove-autocommands*

You can define autocommands that trigger when a mode starts and ends.

>lua
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("WinmoveModeStart", {
        callback = function(event)
            vim.print("Started ".. event.data.mode .. " mode")
        end,
    })
    
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("WinmoveModeEnd", {
        callback = function(event)
            vim.print("Ended ".. event.data.mode .. " mode")
        end,
    })
<


PUBLIC API                                                *winmove-public-api*


  [!WARNING] Consider only the functions below part of the public API. All other
  functions are subject to change.

WINMOVE.CONFIGURE

Configure `winmove`. Also see |winmove-configuration|.


WINMOVE.VERSION

Get the current version of `winmove`.


WINMOVE.CURRENT_MODE

Check which mode is currently active. Returns `"move"`, `"resize"`, or `nil`.


WINMOVE.START_MODE

Start a mode.

>lua
    ---@param mode winmove.Mode
    winmove.start_mode(mode)
    
    -- Example:
    winmove.start_mode(winmove.Mode.Move)
    winmove.start_mode("resize")
<


WINMOVE.STOP_MODE

Stop the current mode. Fails if no mode is currently active.


WINMOVE.MOVE_WINDOW

Move a window (does not need to be the current window). See
|winmove-this-showcase|.

>lua
    ---@param win_id integer
    ---@param dir winmove.Direction
    winmove.move_window(win_id, dir)
    
    -- Example:
    winmove.move_window(1000, "k")
<


WINMOVE.SPLIT_INTO

Split into a window (does not need to be the current window). See
|winmove-this-showcase|.

>lua
    ---@param win_id integer
    ---@param dir winmove.Direction
    winmove.split_into(win_id, dir)
    
    -- Example:
    winmove.split_into(1000, "l")
<


WINMOVE.MOVE_WINDOW_FAR

Move a window as far as possible in a direction (does not need to be the
current window). See |winmove-this-showcase|.

>lua
    ---@param win_id integer
    ---@param dir winmove.Direction
    winmove.move_window_far(win_id, dir)
    
    -- Example:
    winmove.move_window_far(1000, "h")
<


WINMOVE.RESIZE_WINDOW

Resize a window (does not need to be the current window). The window can be
resized relative to an anchor in the top-left or bottom-right corner of the
window.

Resizing respects the `winwidth`/`winminwidth` and `winheight`/`winminheight`
options respectively, with the largest value taking priority. If a window being
resized would shrink another window’s size beyond the values of those
options, the whole row/column of windows are adjusted except if all windows in
the direction of resizing are as small as they can get.

See |winmove-this-showcase|.

>lua
    ---@param win_id integer
    ---@param dir winmove.Direction
    ---@param count integer
    ---@param anchor winmove.ResizeAnchor?
    winmove.resize_window(win_id, dir, count, anchor)
    
    -- Example:
    winmove.resize_window(1000, "j", 3, winmove.ResizeAnchor.TopLeft)
    winmove.resize_window(1000, "l", 1, winmove.ResizeAnchor.BottomRight)
<

Q: WHY CREATE THIS PROJECT?

**A**: There are |winmove-already-a-few-projects| for moving windows but none
of them felt intuitive to me so I did the only rational thing a developer would
do in this situation and created my own plugin. If any of the others suit your
needs then by all means use them.

MOVING AROUND WINDOWS ~


  [!IMPORTANT] Moving windows takes into account the cursor position of the
  current window relative to the target window in the direction you are moving.
  For example, if your cursor position is closest to the bottom of one window in
  the target direction, the window will be moved below that window. See
  |winmove-this-example| for a visual explanation.

MOVING USING RELATIVE CURSOR POSITION ~


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fce8ab8-4ba4-4869-8ab8-220f653541d8


SPLITTING INTO WINDOWS ~

As opposed to moving windows, which will squeeze a window in between other
windows, splitting into a window will move it next to a target window.

RESIZING WINDOWS ~


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f77c9c4-dca1-4647-9049-8695e5351431

Resizing respects the `winwidth`/`winminwidth` and `winheight`/`winminheight`
options respectively, with the largest value taking priority. If a window being
resized would shrink another window’s size beyond the values of those
options, the whole row/column of windows are adjusted except if all windows in
the direction of resizing are as small as they can get.
