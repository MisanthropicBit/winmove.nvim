> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Moving and swapping windows takes into account the cursor position of the
> current window relative to the target window in the direction you are moving
> or swapping.

> For example, if your cursor position is closest to the bottom of one window in
> the target direction, the window will be moved below that window. See
